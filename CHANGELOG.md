# Changelog

All notable changes to Verg are logged here as they're made. Dates are
when the change was written, not necessarily released.

## [Unreleased] — build 11

### Added
- 5-screen onboarding (what Verg is, the ritual, weekly commitment,
  computed projection, rating prompt) feeding directly into the paywall —
  replaces the old 3-screen flow that never showed a paywall at all.
- `OnboardingProjection`: pure, tested arithmetic for the projection
  screen (days/week → pages/hours a year), computed per commitment.
- Weekly-goal milestone track (`WeeklyGoalMilestone`, `WeeklyGoalTracker`)
  — celebrates 1/4/12/26/52 completed weeks meeting the user's chosen
  days-per-week pace, additive alongside the existing page-count
  milestones. Surfaced in Stats as a "Weekly Goal" card once a commitment
  is set.
- `RatingPromptService`: shared `AppStore.requestReview` trigger
  (`SKStoreReviewController` fallback below iOS 18), fired from exactly
  two places — the onboarding rating-prompt screen, and after the bell on
  day 3 of an active streak. Never on cold launch, never twice a session.
- `ProductIdentifiers.swift` — single source of truth for the
  `Verg_Monthly`/`Verg_Yearly` product IDs.
- Stats tab reskin: warm gradient/glow icon treatment matching the
  milestone and Time Reclaimed reveal screens; friendlier header copy.

### Changed
- **Free tier regated**: writing (lighting the candle, the timer, the
  bell) is now always free and unlimited. The paywall only gates saving a
  page beyond the first free one — previously it blocked starting a 4th
  session entirely.
- Default timer duration is now 10 minutes (was 15), matching the app's
  own pitch copy and the projection math.
- Trial is yearly-only now — Monthly's introductory offer removed (see
  RELEASE_NOTES_2.2.md's manual-actions list for the App Store
  Connect/RevenueCat side of this).

### Removed
- `OnboardingPageView` — the old homogeneous onboarding page template,
  unused after the 5-step rebuild (each step is a bespoke view now; the
  screens don't share a common shape).

## Earlier — build 1–10 (2026-08-22, same day)

Not individually logged (this file didn't exist yet), but for reference,
this build range covers the rest of 2.2: legacy image migration + file
protection, pinch-to-zoom/pan/swipe-dismiss in the fullscreen viewer (plus
a zoom-runaway bug fix), the Time Reclaimed feature (foreground-only
writing-time tracking, full-screen post-session reveal, weekly/all-time
stats), and a real `VergTests` XCTest target (didn't exist before —
`Tests/*.swift` sat unwired to anything).
